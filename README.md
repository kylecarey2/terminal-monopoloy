# Terminal-Monopoly

Terminal-Monopoly is a way to play monopoly in the terminal created in c++. This project was created over winter break of my freshman year and was presented for the ACM code showdown. This project is still a work in progress and lacks documentation throughout. I intend to document this project fully soon. 

## Usage

To create an executable file to play the game, run make. It is dependant on if you have a prop.txt file in the directory. If you choose to edit the prop.txt file to update property information, only edit the name and price column.
